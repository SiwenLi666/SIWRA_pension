# Pension Advisor RAG System Functionality Summary
Date: April 9, 2025

## Core Features

1. **Hybrid Retrieval System**
   - Combined BM25 and vector search for improved document retrieval
   - Configurable weighting between keyword and semantic search (currently 40% BM25, 60% vector)
   - Performance metrics logging for retrieval operations
   - IMPORTANT: Only retrieves information from explicitly embedded documents (currently PA16 and SKR2023)

2. **Document Processing**
   - Enhanced metadata extraction for acronyms and definitions
   - Structured extraction of transitional provisions
   - Automatic creation of document chunks for efficient retrieval

3. **Answer Generation**
   - Answer verification to prevent empty or unhelpful responses
   - Structured answer templates for different question types
   - Post-processing to ensure answers include all requested information
   - Enhanced handling of comparison questions
   - Confidence scoring for generated answers

4. **User Experience**
   - User feedback mechanism for rating answer quality
   - Conversation context management for multi-turn interactions
   - Follow-up question suggestions based on conversation history
   - Multi-language support (primarily Swedish and English)

5. **Agent Architecture**
   - LangGraph-based agent workflow
   - Specialized agents for different tasks:
     - AnswerAgent: Generates initial answers
     - RefinerAgent: Improves and refines answers
     - MissingFieldsAgent: Handles incomplete queries
   - State management for tracking conversation flow

## Known Issues and Bugs

1. **Limited Agreement Coverage**
   - Currently ONLY PA16 and SKR2023 agreements are embedded in the system
   - The system should NOT reference or provide information about other agreements (ITP1, ITP2, SAF-LO) as they are not in the embedded documents
   - Any information about non-embedded agreements would come from the LLM's general knowledge, not from RAG retrieval, which defeats the purpose of the system

2. **Calculation Reliability Issues**
   - System provides generic responses to calculation questions without requesting necessary data
   - Should behave like a human advisor and ask for specific personal data before providing calculations
   - Example: When asked "Hur mycket kan jag förvänta mig att få i pension?", system gives generic information instead of requesting age, income, etc.

3. **Feedback Mechanism Broken**
   - The feedback buttons ("Var detta svaret hjälpsamt?") are not functioning correctly
   - Clicks on feedback options do not register properly

4. **Port Binding Conflicts**
   - Application may fail to start if port 9090 is already in use
   - Requires manual termination of existing processes using the port

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to the project directory: `D:\AI folder\AI agent\LangGraph_agent\SIWRA_pension_restructured`
   - Activate the virtual environment: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Run the application: `python main.py`
   - Wait for the message: "Uvicorn running on http://localhost:9090"
   - Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:9090

2. **Select Language**
   - The system automatically detects the language you use
   - You can start with either Swedish or English
   - Example Swedish greeting: "Hej, jag behöver hjälp med min pension"
   - Example English greeting: "Hello, I need help with my pension"

### Testing Question Answering

1. **Basic Information Queries**
   - Ask about general pension concepts from the available agreements (PA16 and SKR2023):
     - "Vad är PA16?"
     - "Hur fungerar efterlevandeskydd i PA16?"
     - "När kan jag gå i pension enligt PA16?"
     - "Vad säger SKR2023 om pensionsålder?"
   - The system should provide relevant information from the embedded documents

2. **Follow-up Questions**
   - After receiving an answer, use the suggested follow-up questions that appear below the response
   - Click on any of the suggested questions to continue the conversation
   - Or ask your own follow-up question related to the previous topic

3. **Agreement Exploration**
   - Ask detailed questions about specific sections of the available agreements:
     - "Vad säger PA16 Avdelning 1 om ålderspension?"
     - "Hur beräknas pensionen enligt PA16 Avdelning 2?"
     - "Vad är skillnaden mellan PA16 Avdelning 1 och Avdelning 2?"

### Testing Calculation Features

1. **Request a Basic Calculation**
   - Ask a calculation question: "Hur mycket pension kan jag få om jag går i pension vid 65?"
   - Note: The system should ask for more information but currently may provide generic answers
   - **Expected behavior (not yet implemented)**: System should ask for your current age, income, and other relevant details

2. **Early Retirement Impact**
   - Ask: "Hur påverkas min pension om jag går i pension vid 63 istället för 65?"
   - Again, the system should request personal details before providing calculations

3. **Retirement Scenarios**
   - Ask: "Kan du jämföra min pension om jag går i pension vid 65 jämfört med 67?"
   - The system should provide a comparison of the scenarios

### Testing Interactive Features

1. **Providing Feedback**
   - After receiving an answer, look for the feedback question: "Var detta svaret hjälpsamt?"
   - Click on one of the feedback options
   - Note: This feature is currently not working correctly

2. **Viewing Conversation History**
   - The conversation history is displayed in the chat interface
   - Previous questions and answers are maintained throughout the session

3. **Changing Topics**
   - Start a new topic by asking an unrelated question
   - The system should recognize the topic change and respond appropriately

### Testing Language Support

1. **Switch Languages Mid-Conversation**
   - Start in Swedish, then switch to English (or vice versa)
   - Example: Start with "Vad är PA16?" then follow up with "Can you explain this in English?"
   - The system should detect the language change and respond accordingly

## Implementation Status

- **Completed Phases**:
  - Phase 1.1: Hybrid retrieval system
  - Phase 3.1: Answer verification
  - Phase 3.3: Answer post-processing
  - Phase 4.3: Follow-up suggestions

- **In Progress**:
  - Performance dashboard
  - Question categorization
  - Improved calculation agent with proper data collection

- **Planned**:
  - User preferences
  - Enhanced visualization
  - Additional agreement embeddings
  - Fix for feedback mechanism

## Development Priorities

1. Fix the calculation agent to request necessary personal data before providing calculations
2. Add more pension agreements to the document database
3. Ensure the system ONLY provides information from embedded documents
4. Repair the feedback mechanism
5. Implement proper error handling for port conflicts
6. Enhance the user interface with clearer instructions and guidance
