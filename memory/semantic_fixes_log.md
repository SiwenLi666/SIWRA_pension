# Semantic Fixes Implementation Log

## Overview

This log documents the implementation of semantic fixes to improve answer quality and trust in the Pension Advisor RAG system. The changes focused on three main areas:

1. Reinstating Pension Glossary Integration
2. Fixing Reference Formatting for Missing PDF File Names
3. Implementing Smart Fallback When No Agreement Is Mentioned

## Changes Made

### 1. Pension Glossary Integration

- Created a new `glossary_utils.py` module that contains:
  - Dictionary of pension terms and their definitions (imported from `document_processor.py`)
  - Extended glossary with additional pension-related terms
  - Functions to detect glossary queries and generate glossary responses
- Integrated glossary lookup in the `VectorRetrieverTool.run()` method to check if a query matches a glossary term
- Added fallback to RAG when glossary doesn't have an answer or when the term isn't found

### 2. Reference Formatting for Missing PDF File Names

- Updated reference formatting in `_generate_response` method to include PDF filename
- Added helper function `extract_filename_from_path` to extract filename from full path
- Modified reference parts construction to follow the format: "PA16 | filename.pdf | sida 1, 2, 3"
- Limited page numbers to top 1-3 pages with highest similarity
- Ensured consistent reference formatting across both single-agreement and multi-agreement responses

### 3. Smart Fallback When No Agreement Is Mentioned

- Enhanced agreement detection to be more robust in `agreement_utils.py`
- Implemented `group_documents_by_agreement` function to group retrieved documents by agreement name
- Created a new `_generate_multi_agreement_response` method that:
  - Groups documents by agreement
  - Generates separate summaries for each agreement
  - Formats the output with clear sections for each agreement
- Updated the `run` method to use smart fallback when no agreement is specified in the query
- Added comprehensive logging to track when fallback is triggered

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created:

1. **`src/utils/glossary_utils.py`**
   - Contains the glossary dictionary and utility functions for glossary lookup

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/utils/agreement_utils.py`**
   - Added `group_documents_by_agreement` function
   - Added `extract_filename_from_path` function
   - Updated `filter_documents_by_agreement` to support smart fallback

2. **`src/tools/vector_retriever.py`**
   - Added glossary integration in the `run` method
   - Updated reference formatting to include PDF filenames
   - Added `_generate_multi_agreement_response` method for smart fallback
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested with the following test cases:

1. **"Vad är PA16?"** → Returns glossary answer with definition of PA16
2. **"Vad är pensionsålder?"** → Returns glossary answer with definition of pensionsålder
3. **"Vad är ändringarna i pensionsavtalet?"** → Returns grouped summary per agreement (PA16 and SKR2023)
4. **"När börjar nya regler i PA16?"** → Returns information from PA16 only
5. **"När börjar regler i ITP1?"** → Returns information from ITP1 only (or indicates no information if not available)

All test cases produced the expected results, with proper reference formatting and appropriate fallback behavior.

## Conclusion

These semantic fixes significantly improve the quality and trustworthiness of the Pension Advisor RAG system by:

1. Providing direct answers for common pension terms through the glossary
2. Making references more precise and traceable with the inclusion of PDF filenames
3. Offering more comprehensive answers when no specific agreement is mentioned

The system now provides clearer, more accurate responses with proper source attribution, enhancing user trust and understanding.
