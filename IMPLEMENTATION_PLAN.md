## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### How to Use This Plan
1. As each task is completed, change "[ ]" to "[x]" and update the text color to green
2. Add implementation details or notes under each item as needed
3. Document any challenges or decisions made during implementation

### Priority Order
1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Phase 1.1, 2.1, 3.1 (Hybrid retrieval, acronym extraction, answer verification)
2. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Phase 2.2, 3.2, 3.3 (Transitional provisions, structured templates, post-processing)
3. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Phase 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 (Comparison questions, confidence scoring, calculation agent, data extraction)
4. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Phase 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6 (Follow-up suggestions, suggestion statistics, suggestion dashboard)
5. **NEXT PRIORITY** - Phase 4.3, 4.4 (Context management, logging, categorization)
6. Phase 5.1-5.5 (User profiles, session tracking, personalization)

### Rollback Procedure
1. Each feature is implemented with feature flags in config.py
2. To rollback, set the corresponding flag to False
3. Keep backup copies of modified files for quick manual rollback if needed
4. Document dependencies between features for safe rollbacks
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Create unit tests for each new feature
2. Document all changes in the system documentation
3. Conduct regular performance testing after each phase
4. Focus on modular design to simplify future extensions
5. Use feature flags for gradual rollout and testing
